# Introduction
This repository contains the necessary files and instructions to set up a local environment using Docker and Docker Compose. The Docker Compose YAML file provided in this repository will deploy the following services:

- Airflow: An open-source workflow management platform.
- Minio: An object bucket
- MySQL: A RDBMS
- Selenium(Python): A browser automation tool. Good for Functional testing.
- Vault: A secure secrets storage.
- Kafka: A distributed streaming platform.
- MongoDB: A document-oriented database.
- ZooKeeper: A centralized service for maintaining configuration information.
- Jenkins: An open-source automation server.
- Keycloak: An open-source identity and access management solution.
- Krakend: An ultra-fast API gateway.
- Nexus: A repository manager for storing and managing software components.
- NiFi: A data integration and processing framework.
- Wiki.js: A modern and powerful wiki platform.
- Grafana stack: A comprehensive monitoring and visualization solution.

# Prerequisites
Before you can set up the local environment using Docker Compose, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

# Setup Instructions
To set up the local environment, follow these steps:
- Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Svastikkka/DOCKER.git
```
- Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
```
cd <repository-directory>
```
- Update the necessary configuration settings in the docker-compose.yml file according to your requirements. You may need to modify port numbers, environment variables, or volume mounts.

- Start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
This command will build and launch the containers in detached mode. You can omit the -d flag if you want to see the logs in the console.

- Wait for the containers to start up. You can check the status of the containers by running:
```
docker-compose ps
```

# Additional Notes
Each service may have its own specific configuration or setup steps. Please refer to the respective documentation for more information on how to customize or use each service.
Make sure to allocate enough resources (CPU, memory, etc.) to Docker to run the entire stack smoothly.
To stop and remove the containers, run the following command:
```
docker-compose down
```

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the setup or while using the local environment, please check the following:

Verify that you have the latest versions of Docker and Docker Compose installed.
Ensure that the necessary ports specified in the docker-compose.yml file are available and not being used by other applications
